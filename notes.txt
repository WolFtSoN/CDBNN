What we checked:
for a specific chip, bank UDIMM (SK-Hynix)
1) Subarray boundries
2) Maj3-5-9 success rates - for random patterns.
    2.1) Including optimal timing parameters
3) Multi-Row-Copy - 100% works for up to 2,4 rows
    3.1) Including optimal timing parameters
--------
What we want to know in order to start using as compute resource:
1) Optimal computation row:
    1.1) can perform MAJ3 almost perfectly - minimum error probability
    1.2) can copy into it almost perfectly - minimum error on copy, zero probability to override a different row. I.e. row copy is exact
    1.3) Optimal timing parameters for each basic operation
2) Optimal frac location
3) AND / OR - find optimum place for 0 / 1 operands
4) Sub-array parallelism (many sub arrays)

We've found out several problems:
-MAJ3 with 12 rows test had a bug (pattern had 3 frac rows, but no frac operation was used) - we can't use the results obtained.
-When tested manually the best rows for MAJ3 with 4 rows we observed:
--When using 1st row as FRAC, it seemed that output always goes like the "strong row" i.e. R1.
--When using R1 as FRAC, it seemed that output favored 1. We tried the following to no clear conclusion:
---Start R1 as 0 before appkying FRAC
---Playing with FRAC params (t_frac, n_frac) 
----for t_frac 0 (like the test), n_frac didn't have effect
----for t_frac 1, n_frac did have effect, though the change observed didn't make sense
--We might want to retest this in a more orderly way
-When tested manually the best rows for MAJ3 with 16 rows we observed:
--Similar, even more confusing behavior to 4 rows
---Shockingly, R1 was more dominant even than the rest of the 14 compute rows.

Possible debug routes/problems we thought off:
1. We don't interpret the test results correctly, or the test isn't comprehensive enough
2. FRAC operation don't work properly

We want to check this out tommorow.

Good progress with yesterday's problems.
We found out several bugs in our scripts, mainly:
1. Wrong bank id used in our manual check (MAJ3 dir)
2. We cross tested for different t12, t23 for rows that didn't support such timings

Results are much better and in line with manual testing. 
We still suspect FRAC parameters might be suboptimal, as MAJ3 using 6,12 rows is far superior to 8,16 rows
